Fully-funded research visit through the JSPS Summer Fellowship Scheme (deferred from 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic). The program provides a grant award to undertake research at a host institution in Japan as part of the recipients PhD studies. The prescribed period of stay is approximately 2 months during summer. 

My personal visit was to the TadoLab, working under the supervision of Dr. Kenjiro Tadakuma as part of the Plus Ultra Mechanisms Group at Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. 

Project entailed the design and initial prototype development of a variable stiffness manipulator.
