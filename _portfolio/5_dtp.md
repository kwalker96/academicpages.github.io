I was 1 of 7 prospective PhD candidates selected to receive the scholarship to assist with undertaking a PhD, my chosen topic being in Subsea Robotics at the University of Edinburgh. 

This provided financial backing to assist me throughout my period of extended study, as well as the opportunity to collaborate with the departments academic and industrial links around the world.

EPSRC is the main UK government agency for funding research and training in engineering and the physical sciences.
