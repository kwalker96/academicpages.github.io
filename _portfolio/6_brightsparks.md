"Electronics Weekly and RS believe that by celebrating the achievements of the most talented young people in the electronics world, we can play a significant role in inspiring and encouraging new entrants to the industry. This is particularly important in the context of the industry‚Äôs well-publicised skills gap and the efforts of the UK government and other organisations to encourage greater take-up in schools and universities of STEM and engineering-related subjects.

EW BrightSparks, in partnership with RS Components, will also serve to inspire other newcomers to the sector or those interested in a career in electronics.

We are looking for engineers between the ages of 18 and 30 who are working or studying in the UK ‚Äì so those who are still in the early stages of their career and who will be the people shaping UK electronics in the years to come."
