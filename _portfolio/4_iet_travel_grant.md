The grant I obtained helped facilitate my visit to IROS 2022 - Kyoto. This was awarded through application and helped fund travel and accommodation whilst in Japan as part of the JSPS Summer Program. 

An amazing experience and my first major conference I was able to visit and network at post-Covid19 pandemic.
