Woohoo! 

Extremely glad to announce that I successfully defended my PhD Thesis titled "Preview-Based Control Methods for Ocean Wave Disturbance Mitigation for Underwater Robots". 

Huge huge thanks to my supervisor Dr. Francesco Giorgio-Serchi who supported me every step of the way, as well as to my examiners Dr. Brian Sellar (University of Edinburgh) and Dr. Gabrielle Ferri (NATO STO-Centre for Maritime Reasearch and Experimentation). Likewise a massive thanks to everyone along the journey over the last 4 years, it's been a blast.
