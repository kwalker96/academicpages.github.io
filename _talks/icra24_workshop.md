Our workshop proposal "(Re)designing the tree of robotic life: a game of alternative timelines" has been accepted to ICRA 2024! 

The workshop aims to challenge existing notions of what robots are, how they are built and controlled, and how they interact with their environments. In teams, the participants will explore scenarios in which the shifting tides of evolutionary history have resulted in a new (robotic) tree of life; the goal will be to come up with radically new robot concepts suited to this reality.
